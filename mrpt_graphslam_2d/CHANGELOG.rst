* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Have topic_namespace of agent be the same as its name

  Knowing the transformation from own graph to neighbor's graph I
  integrate into own map the rest of the received nodes in batches of X
  nodes (default=4)

  Multi-robot SLAM is no longer (heavily) based on Condensed Measurements,
  thus the corresponding files/classes are named appropriately.
  MR: Multi-robot
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Finish first working version of mr-graphSLAM
* mrpt-graphslam: Add more rviz files for gazebo
  Commit also temporarily deals with the segfault when running with more
  than 2 robots
* Finish first working version of map_merger node
  map_merger node subscribes to all the published maps and trajectories,
  fetches the results and upon user request computes an appropriate
  occupancy-grid map merging and joins all available maps and robot
  trajectories
* Start work on map_merger script
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Class app to properly inherit from CGraphSlamHandler
  Add to mr-graphSLAM execution, various bug fixes
  Robot agents can now communicate LaserScans, modified node lists as well
  as condensed-measurements maps and upon successful matching integrate
  local map of other agent into own map.
* mrpt-graphslam-2d: Implement mr-graphSLAM communication system and structs
  Commit adds the necessary structures for basic communication of nodes,
  current LaserScan in a multi-robot graphSLAM application.
  Each graphSLAM agent publishes the last X nodes (node ID + pose) and its
  latest registered laser scan into corresponding topics under its own
  namespace. Furthermore each agent reads the aforementioned stats off the
  topics of all other agents that are currently running in the experiment.
  P.S. In the current implementation, each graphSLAM agent keeps a
  TNeighborAgentProps instance structure for each one of its found neighbors
  (*not* including self).
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Add copyright string
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Add to multi-robot CGraphSlamEngine
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Implement conversion methods TSlamAgent <=> RosMaster
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Have two different executables for sr, mr slam
  mrpt_graphslam_2d_node => single-robot graphSLAM
  mrpt_graphslam_2d_cm_node => multi-robot graphSLAM based on Condensed Measurements
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Name classes, files in a consistent manner
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Add ROS-specific, CondensedMeasurements-specific classes
  To facilitate polymorphism, task delegation, we implement class
  templates specific to the MR-graphSLAM strategy that inherit from
  mrpt-graphslam lib class templates
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Add mr related class and executable
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Add graphSLAM statistics topic -> feedback/graphslam_stats
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Uncomment actual code snippet in main executable
* mrpt-graphslam-2d: Depend on multimaster_fkie pkg
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Add draft version of CConnectionManager class
  CConnectionManager should be responsible for handling the inter-robot
  communication in an mr-slam setup. it basically provides a wrapper
  around the Multimaster package for finding other ROS masters in the same
  network over multicast
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Abide to changes in mrpt-graphslam API
* mrpt-graphslam-2d: Add specialized versions of rviz files for Gazebo sim
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Change script names
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Add boilerplate code for multi-robot decider/optimizer classes.
  Multi-robot case is going to be implemented on the ROS side. Current
  commit adds code for the new multi-robot deciders/optimizer classes as
  well as verifying that the classes that are inputted by the user
  actually exist.
* Edit README.md file
* fix project name
* Define C++11 avoiding direct manipulation of CXX_FLAGS
* catkin_lint error fixes

0.1.5 (2016-11-18)
------------------
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Correct syntax in README file
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Complete the demo rviz, launch files
  Finish setting up the demos-related files.
  Setup a hierarchy of launchfiles with each each one delegating the
  corresponding tasks to the next one with the sr_graphslam.launch as the
  final link in this chain. This should make up for an easier maintenance
  of the whole setup later on.
* Renamed demo bagfile
* Be consistent with rviz, launchfile names
* Readd demo_short_loop bag
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Add demo_gt launchfile for launching demo rosbag
* Skip mrpt_graphslam_2d compilation if MRPT version < 1.5.0
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Add rviz file for complete single-robot SLAM experiment
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Use tf2 for all tf transformations.
  Commit also includes the following:
  - Introduction of the "anchor node", that is the frame that (a specific)
  robot trajectory starts from, which should also differ from the world
  frame in a multi-robot setup.
  - Odometry input messages are expected to be of type nav_msgs::Odometry,
  instead of the custom msg Pose2DStamped used so far
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Make changes to graphslam.launch file
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Add to the launchfiles
* Contributors: Nikos Koukis

0.1.4 (2016-11-06)
------------------
* Add install targets to CMake.
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Init MR-SLAM configuration
  Commit adds boilerplate code for:
  - Launchfile with nested topic and TF groups for manipulating more
  robotic agents in a consistent manner
  - New .rviz file for MR-SLAM
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: queue_size as a private member
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Cleanup CMakeLists file, add catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS
* Add demo workspace picture
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Make changes to README instructions and app launchfiles
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Initialize demo folder, Modify README
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Add to the feedback results
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Initialize feedback topics
  Provide feedback information that can be accessed via ROS Topics. These
  utilize the CGraphslamEngine API and include the following:
  - Latest robot pose
  - Estimated path trajectory
* mprt_graphslam_2d: Use m\_ prefix for class private vars
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Save result files after execution
* Add README file.
* mrpt_graphslam_2d:Add launchfile, configfile
* mrpt_graphslam_2d: Initialize ROS wrapper for mrpt-graphslam
  Commit includes boilerplate code for running graphSLAM using the
  mrpt-graphslam library.
  The following should be noted:
  - mrpt_graphslam_2d is heavily based on the native MRPT
  graphslam-engine_app application.
  - graphslam-engine_app command line arguments correspond to parameters
  in the /graphslam_engine namespace of the ROS parameter server and can
  be set either by an external launchfile or by dirctly by the user.
